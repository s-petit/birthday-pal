# What is birthday-pal

A simple CardDAV birthday email reminder

The goal of this app is to remind you birthdays of your contacts, by sending emails.

There are many ways to save or consult birthdays of your friends and family, but the simplest way is to store it inside your contacts app.

It depends on your contacts provider, but in most cases, it does not provide reminder of birthdays, like calendars do for events.

Sometimes, birthdays are displayed as a Calendar, which is fine, but you still have to verify frequently the birthdays if you don't want to forget to wish it.

## How does it work

This app uses standard protocols to achieve its simple but necessary task : 

- CardDAV and Vcards for contacts because this is the standard and offers the best compatibily between contact systems.
- Emails / SMTP for reminders - Everyone consults his mailbox daily

You just have to provide :

- A Vcard file or a CardDAV server URL with credentials
- Your SMTP server URL with credentials
- The recipients

## How to use it

birthday-pal is a stateless executable app which needs :

- CardDav server URL, which includes (or not) BasicAuth credentials : https://USER:PASS@carddav.YOURPROVIDER.com/URL
- SMTP server informations : host, username and password
- Recipients list
- Business Parameters like : nbDaysBefore, RepeatUntil...


Here is one exemple :

`birthday-pal https://USER:PASS@carddav.PROVIDER.com/URL smtp.PROVIDER.com SMTP_USERNAME SMTP_PASS 3 true foo@mail.com bar@mail.com`


At this point, the CLI invokation is pretty unclear and verbose and it will be evolve as something like that :


``
birthday-pal

  --carddav https://USER:PASS@carddav.PROVIDER.com/URL
  --smtphost smtp.PROVIDER.com
  --smtpuser SMTP_USERNAME
  --smtppass SMTP_PASS
  --recipients foo@mail.com bar@mail.com
  --remindBefore 3
  --repeatEveryDay true

```

## Design and limitations

birthday-pal is a simple executable which will perform its task once, as a one-shot. If you want to automate executions in a specific amount of time, let's say, daily or weekly, you have to deploy it on a server which runs permanently, and setup a cron yourself.

It was designed to run inside docker containers or a linux-based system on a server or NAS (like Synology)

Prequisites :

- Go or Docker
